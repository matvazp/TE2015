# Configuration guides

## **Git Installation and Configuration**
Git is a version control system that allows to keep track of the changes we make to our files, in this case, our MPLAB X project files. The most important feature of version control is that we can easily go back to a previous version of our files in case we want to, even though new changes have been saved on our files. This way if a new version of a project does not satisfy your requirements, we can go back to the version before the changes were applied and start over.

Moreover, we can submit these files to the cloud so other developers can access them and make changes as well, such as our team mates when working on a laboratory for class. One of these cloud services is GitHub, which we will use on our course. In this sense, we will use Git commands to upload our project files to GitHub where we will keep them in our own repository. Follow the steps below to install Git on your computer, and then, configure your GitHub repository to upload your project files.

## **MPLAB X and XC8 Compiler Installation**
To configure the Integrated Development Environment we have to follow two different processes. First, we need to install MPLAB X software tool, which is the environment where we develop our projects. Then, we install the compiler that MPLAB X will use to compile our programs and generate the file that is downloaded to our MCU.
